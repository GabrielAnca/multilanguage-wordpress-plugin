<a href="http://bestwebsoft.com/products/multilanguage/" target=_blank>Multilanguage WordPress Plugin</a>
========================

Multilanguage allows you to create a multilingual WordPress website. Hence, you can create or edit posts, pages, or create categories and post tags as usual, and then define the language for each of them. The translation of a post, whether it was created in the default language or not, is optional. All translations must be done manually using Multilanguage plugin, because it does not integrate any automatic or professional translation service.
